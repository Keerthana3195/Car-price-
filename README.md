# Car-price-prediction_using-Azure-ML-and-python

### Background
Cars are life and blood of the commutation. Making it affordable is the biggest challenge encountered by the
stakeholders. There are several factors that affect price of the car. Each of the factors plays unique role. These
attributes spread across fuel type, car body, engine size, horsepower, no. of cylinders, etc. Prediction of the
price based on these factors can be a game changer. Stakeholders can draw useful conclusions from such
predictions. For example, manufacturers can use such predictions to reduce the total cost based on certain
manipulations in these factors and maximize the total profit. Another good example can be, vendors using such
predictions to capture the market and boost the sales. Moreover, such predictions can be a valuable aid to the
customers while ranking their preferences and corresponding them with the monetary value they are willing to
spend. Such insights can contribute towards globalization as well. This can be untangled to a scenario where
companies enter the markets of foreign countries by increasing their delivered quality at an affordable value.


### Motivation
The prices of new cars within the business are fastened by the manufacturer with some extra prices incurred by
the government in the form of taxes. So, customers shopping for a brand new automotive can be assured of the
cash they invest to be worthy. In auto sales, several factors contribute towards the total cost of the cars. For
example, fuel type, carâ€™s body, engine size, horsepower, no. of cylinders, etc. With the sales of the cars
increasing and changing rapidly worldwide, what affects the units of new car sales has become a topic of mass
interest. Based on the existing data, we aim to use the data mining algorithms to predict the price of the cars
based on the factors that affect the price.
